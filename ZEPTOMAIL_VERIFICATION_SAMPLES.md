## 📋 Why These Are Transactional Emails

ZeptoMail defines transactional emails as:

✅ **Triggered by user action** - All our emails are triggered by specific events:
- User creates account → Welcome email
- User refers someone → Referral notification
- Referral makes deposit → Earnings notification
- User requests withdrawal → Confirmation email
- Admin processes withdrawal → Status update email

✅ **Contain transaction/account info** - Every email contains:
- Specific amounts (points, money)
- Transaction IDs and references
- Account-specific data
- Status updates

✅ **Required for service functionality** - Users need these emails to:
- Confirm their account creation
- Track their earnings
- Monitor withdrawal requests
- Receive transaction confirmations

❌ **NOT marketing emails** - We do NOT send:
- Promotional campaigns
- Product announcements
- Newsletters
- Bulk marketing messages
- Sales pitches

---

## 🎯 Compliance Points to Emphasize

When ZeptoMail reviews your application, emphasize:

1. **100% Transactional** - Every email is triggered by a user action
2. **User-initiated** - All emails relate to actions the user took
3. **Financial notifications** - Most emails involve money transactions
4. **Required for functionality** - Users need these to use the platform
5. **One-to-one** - Each email goes to one specific user about their account
6. **Time-sensitive** - Transaction confirmations need immediate delivery
7. **Audit trail** - These emails serve as transaction records
